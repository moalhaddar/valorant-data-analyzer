# Where does the tool get the data from?
This tool does not connect to riot servers nor it collects your username and password. You have to supply it the data manually. To get the data, you need to make a ticket requesting the data from riot. To do so, visit [Submit a request/ticket page](https://support-valorant.riotgames.com/hc/en-us/requests/new) and select request type of `Account Management, Data Requests, or Deletion`. After making the request, you will have to wait 30 days before riot sends you the data.

# After getting the data, where do i place it?
After getting the `data.zip` file, you will have to unzip it, you will find your match history in `./data/valorant_match_history.json`. You will need to copy this file to the root of this project and replace the existing dummy `valorant_match_history.json` file.

# Requirements
You will need yarn/npm package manager installed in your machine to run this tool

# How to run
Simply run the following commands in the root directory of this project
